# 💊 PROJECT — RxGuardian

**RxGuardian** is an advanced **Pharmacy Management System (PMS)** designed to streamline pharmacy operations by providing robust tools for **inventory control, billing, analytics, workforce management, and communication**.  

This repository currently represents the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**. Several enterprise-grade features are under active development. 🚀  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter (cross-platform mobile & desktop UI)  
- **Backend:** Node.js (REST API + WebSocket server)  
- **Authentication:** Firebase + JWT (hybrid model for scalability and security)  
- **Database:** MySQL (Oracle-based distribution) with Redis for caching  
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.IO  

---

##  Core Features

1. **Authentication & Security**  
   - Hybrid Firebase + JWT flow for multi-layered security  
   - Session handling with refresh tokens  

2. **Inventory & Stock Management**  
   - Real-time stock visibility  
   - Low-stock and expiry alerts  

3. **Point of Sale (POS) Console**  
   - Fast, dedicated billing interface  
   - Integrated **customer management module**  

4. **Business Analytics**  
   - Daily, monthly, and yearly reports  
   - Sales trends, stock consumption, and drug performance  

5. **Procurement Panel**  
   - Direct purchase of medicines from manufacturers  
   - Streamlined vendor integration  

6. **Manager Console**  
   - Track employee performance and sales contribution  
   - Remote pharmacist hiring & role-based access  

7. **Integrated Chat System**  
   - Role-based rooms (e.g., divisions/teams)  
   - Message editing, reactions, and threaded replies  

8. **AI-Driven Insights (Planned)**  
   - Predictive analytics for billing, procurement, and hiring  
   - Demand forecasting with anomaly detection

## Optimizations
- Optimized SQL queries for performance  
- Transaction-based query failure management  
- **70% faster response time** via Redis caching using **Cache Aside Pattern** where app manages cache explicitly
- Secure WebSocket-based chat with Socket.IO  
- ACID principles achieved via transactions for APIs making multiple queries at once, others are by default implicitly handled by MySQL's InnoDB engine
